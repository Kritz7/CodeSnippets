# Hello!
I'm Nicholas Blackburn.
Here's some code!

I'm kind of lazy so these snippets are just copied from projects I'm working on with no attempt to make them presentable.

## Loose Units
Screen-funded game I've been working on since 2025. This folder will just contain random scripts that demonstrate my coding style when working on a solo project.

## Archive
Significantly older that significantly younger me made. Not really useful for anything except to maybe see how my coding style has improved.
